# TTBG Mentor Portal MVP

This project implements the first complete mentor-application workflow:

1. A mentor submits the public application form.
2. The application is committed to the database.
3. The logistics team receives an optional email notification.
4. An authorized administrator or logistics user signs in.
5. The team reviews the application and updates its status and internal notes.

## Local setup on Windows

```powershell
cd ttbg-mentor-portal
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace the example secret, administrator email, and password.

Then run:

```powershell
python run.py
```

Open:

- Public form: http://127.0.0.1:5000/apply
- Team login: http://127.0.0.1:5000/login
- Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin

## Email notifications

Email is optional. Applications are saved successfully even when email is
disabled or temporarily fails.

To enable notifications, set these values in `.env`:

```text
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=logistics@thetechnicalbridgegroup.com
PORTAL_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=notifications@thetechnicalbridgegroup.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=notifications@thetechnicalbridgegroup.com
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
SMTP_USE_SSL=false
```

For a Google account using SMTP authentication, do not place the normal Google
account password in this file. Use an application-specific credential where
the account and Workspace security settings permit it.

Keep `.env` private. It is excluded by `.gitignore` and must never be committed.

## Current public application

- Full name
- Email
- Phone
- Years of experience
- Preferred contact method
- Industry / area of expertise
- Tell us about yourself
- Mentorship support areas
- Required acknowledgement

## Database

Local development defaults to SQLite. The same SQLAlchemy models can use
PostgreSQL later by changing `DATABASE_URL`.

Example production format:

```text
postgresql+psycopg://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DATABASE
```

## Current scope

- Public mentor application
- Server-side validation and CSRF protection
- Honeypot spam check
- Secure administrator login
- Application counts and review table
- Application detail view
- Status updates
- Internal notes
- Optional logistics email notification

Not included yet:

- Resume uploads
- Acuity integration
- Stripe Connect onboarding
- Mentor-facing accounts
- Production deployment

## Render demonstration deployment

This repository includes `render.yaml`, which can create a free Render web
service and a free PostgreSQL database together. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` before
deploying.

The free configuration is for demonstration only. Do not connect the live
Squarespace form or collect real applications until the database is upgraded
to a paid production instance.
